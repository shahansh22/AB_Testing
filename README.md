With variables like the day of the week with the most ad displays, the hour of the day with the most ad displays, and the overall number of ads displayed to prospects, 
the code starts with a thorough examination of the information. We'll systematically match each variable with conversion status, producing informative visualisations such as pie charts, 
box plots, and stacked bar charts to find significant trends and patterns.

 Proceed to statistical hypothesis testing, which is the core of A/B testing, when exploratory analysis is finished. 
 To evaluate the connection between the conversion status and categorical variables, we will use the appropriate chi-squared test of dependence. 
 Our findings will also be robustly statistically validated by comparing the distributions of a continuous variable between the two groups using a Mann-Whitney U test.
